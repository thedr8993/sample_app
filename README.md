# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*] (http://railstutorial.org./) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/)

But I edited the README file ;) by [Daniel Rosas](http://apply.devbootcamp.com/s/207966/17785/)

Editing this again because I want to try and make it easier. I think I'm starting to get the hang of this! =)

Hope the link works...if it doesn't, it's supposed to link to my DBC application video and you probably need a password.
